Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This code is intended to develop a diagnostic test to help users differenciate between a sore throat and strep throat. 
There will be four questions asked, each answer will be stored and the final page will show the user the likelyhood they have either a sore throat or strep throat.
 
Known Issues:
Need to add picture
Maybe change calculations to be percents instead of fractions?
